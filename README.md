# Depression Data Analysis (STAT112 Final Project)

This project explores the relationship between various demographic, economic, and personal factors and the depression status of individuals in Australia (2022).  
It was completed as a team project for the STAT112 course at METU.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on:
- Gender, marital status, and number of children
- Education level, income, assets
- Depression status
- Investment and spending habits

##  Data Cleaning Process

- Removed irrelevant punctuation and symbols in column names and values
- Replaced outlier values (e.g., 99 children → median)
- Filled missing values using mode (categorical) and median (numerical)
- Renamed columns for better readability

## Analysis Questions

We explored 8 main questions such as:
- Does education level relate to depression in females?
- Do depressed individuals make long-term financial plans?
- Are saved assets lower among those with depression?
- Is there a connection between gained assets and living expenses for depressed vs. non-depressed?

##  Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Excel
